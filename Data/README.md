### Data Folder

This folder provides descriptions of all data inputs used for calibrating the natural history model and running multi-cancer screening simulations for breast cancer survivors and age-matched average-risk women.\
All data correspond to aggregate, publicly available sources from SEER and U.S. Life Tables.

#### BC_Incidence_nonmet_HR_2011_2015.xlsx

-   *Source: SEER Incidence 2011--2015*\
    Age-specific incidence of non-metastatic breast cancer (AJCC 6th Edition stage I--III), stratified by hormone-receptor status.

#### AllCancers_Incidence_2011_2015.xlsx

-   *Source: SEER Incidence 2011--2015*\
    Age-specific incidence for all cancers combined (excluding non-melanoma skin). Used for modeling subsequent primary cancer risk in the first 5 years after breast cancer diagnosis.

#### Female_all_cause_mortality_2018.xlsx

-   *Source: U.S. Life Tables 2018*\
    Age-specific all-cause mortality rates for U.S. females.

#### MCED_Cancer_List_US_2011_2015.xlsx

-   *Source: SEER Incidence 2011--2015*\
    Age- and stage-specific incidence for the 16 cancers included in the MCED model.\
    Early stage: AJCC6 I--II; Late stage: AJCC6 III--IV.
